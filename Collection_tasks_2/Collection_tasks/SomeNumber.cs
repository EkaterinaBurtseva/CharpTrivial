/*
 * Input int someNumber, value operationType of enum Transform (values Double, Exponent, Square, SquareRoot, PrettyString). 
 * Output transformed number as a string. Double should result in doubled number, Exponent as e^N, etc, PrettyString results 
 * in number formatted to have ' ' as thousands delimiters and ',' as a decimal mark. It should be very easy to add new 
 * operations to enum Transform, since there will be many of them (around 20).
