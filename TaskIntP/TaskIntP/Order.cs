   /* At ACME warehouse the warehouse manager has observed orders taking a long time to pick and
* believes that moving more popular items to easier to access locations may help.
*
* - Workers pick an order by placing items on a pallet at the dock door.
* - Products are stored (inefficiently) in a single aisle with multiple shelves.
* - As the shelf number increases, it is located further down the aisle and
*   further away from the dock door.
* - On average it takes 5*X seconds for a warehouse worker to retrieve an item
* from shelf X and place it on the pallet.
* - A warehouse worker can only carry a single item at a time.
* - A shelf can only hold one type of item.
*
* Which items should be on which shelves to optimize picking speed based on
*  yesterday's orders?
* 
* Example table contents:
*
*   Shelf 1:      Item 12
*   Shelf 2:      Item 11
*   Shelf 3:      Item 10
*   Shelf 4:      Item 09
*   Shelf 5:      Item 08
*   Shelf 6:      Item 07
*   Shelf 7:      Item 06
*   Shelf 8:      Item 05
*   Shelf 9:      Item 04
*   Shelf 10:     Item 03
*   Shelf 11:     Item 02
*   Shelf 12:     Item 01
*
* Display the shelf and item pairings by calling the following function:
*   displayShelfItemPair(shelfName, itemName);
